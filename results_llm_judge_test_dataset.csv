sample8,2,I'm planning to start a garden this spring.,What types of plants are you considering for your garden?,"That's a wonderful idea! Starting a garden can be very rewarding. Here are a few steps to help you get started:

1. **Decide What to Plant**: Start off small and gradually expand. Consider what your family will eat and also what will grow well in your area.

2. **Choose the Right Spot**: Most fruits and vegetables need full sun, with minimum 6 hours of direct sunlight a day. The site should also have good soil.

3. **Clear the Ground**: Get rid of the sod covering the area you plan to plant. If you want quick results, you can dig it out, but it would be easier to smother it with newspaper.

4. **Improve the Soil**: The more fertile the soil, the better your vegetables will grow. The best way to improve the soil is by adding organic matter or compost.

5. **Work the Soil**: Working the soil is essential to preparing new beds for sowing or planting because it allows roots to penetrate the soil more easily to access water and nutrients.

6. **Pick Your Plants**: Some people get a thrill out of buying seeds and starting everything from scratch. Others prefer to buy young plants and just put them in the ground.

7. **Water and Care for Your Garden**: Your garden needs to be watered regularly. Once plants are established, it is better to give your garden a long drink every few days rather than a quick splash every day.

Remember, gardening is a learning process. You're bound to make a few mistakes along the way but don't get discouraged. Just keep trying and before you know it, you'll have a bountiful harvest. Happy gardening!","{'Relevance': 3, 'Engagement': 0, 'Total Score': 3}",
