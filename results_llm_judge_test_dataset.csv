- The AI successfully detected the ambiguity in the user's request. The user's input ""Book a meeting for me tomorrow"" is vague and lacks specific details necessary to complete the task. 
- The AI asked targeted follow-up questions to help narrow down the user's intent. It asked for the time, duration, and participants of the meeting, which are all crucial details for booking a meeting. 
- The AI did not make any incorrect assumptions or proceed with actions before the user clarified their intent. It asked for more information instead of assuming any details about the meeting.
- As this is the first interaction, we cannot evaluate the AI's ability to maintain a natural, human-like flow with no abrupt shifts in tone or behavior after 5 interactions. However, the AI's response is natural and human-like in this interaction. 

Therefore, based on this single interaction, the AI's response is in line with the acceptance criteria.",

- The AI asked a targeted follow-up question to help narrow down the user's intent. By asking the user to specify which report they are referring to, the AI is seeking to understand the user's request better without making any assumptions.
- The AI did not proceed with any actions until the user clarified their intent. Instead of sending a random report or making an assumption about which report the user wanted, the AI asked for clarification.
- As this is only the first interaction, we cannot evaluate the AI's ability to maintain a natural, human-like flow with no abrupt shifts in tone or behavior after 5 interactions. However, the AI's response is in a natural, conversational tone, which suggests it would maintain this tone in subsequent interactions.",
sample4,1,Plan a trip.,"Are you looking to plan a vacation, a business trip, or something else?","Could you please provide more details such as the destination, duration, and dates for the trip?","The AI's response meets all the requirements outlined in the acceptance criteria. 

- The AI successfully detected the ambiguity in the user's request ""Plan a trip."" This request is vague as it does not provide any specifics about the trip.

sample6,2,I've been trying to learn Python.,What aspects of Python are you focusing on right now?,"That's great! Python is a versatile language that's widely used in many areas like web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. 

If you're just getting started, there are many resources available online. Websites like Codecademy, Coursera, and Khan Academy offer Python courses. If you prefer books, ""Learn Python the Hard Way"" by Zed Shaw is highly recommended. 

For practicing, websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars offer Python problems that you can solve. 

Remember, the best way to learn programming is by doing. So, after learning the basics, try to work on some small projects. It could be as simple as a calculator or a to-do list. This will not only help you understand how Python works but also make learning more fun. Happy learning!","The AI's response does not meet the requirements. While the AI provides a detailed and helpful response, it does not generate any contextually relevant follow-up questions based on the user's input.

sample7,2,I just adopted a new puppy.,That's exciting! How is your puppy adjusting to its new home?,"That's wonderful news! Congratulations on your new furry friend. 

Here's a few tips to help you get started:

1. **Create a safe space**: Your puppy needs a safe, comfortable place to relax. A crate or a gated area works well.

2. **Get into a routine**: Dogs thrive on routine. Regular feeding times, potty breaks and walk times will make house training easier.

3. **Training and socializing**: Start training your puppy on basic commands like 'sit', 'stay', 'come'. Also, it's important to expose your puppy to different people, environments, and other animals to help them become well-adjusted adults.

4. **Nutrition**: Consult with your vet to ensure you're feeding your puppy a balanced diet.

5. **Regular Vet Check-ups**: Puppies need several rounds of vaccinations in their first year, and regular check-ups to monitor their growth and health.

Remember, every puppy is unique and may require different care. Don't hesitate to ask your vet or a professional dog trainer for guidance. Enjoy this special time with your new puppy!","The AI's response does not meet the requirements. While the AI provides a detailed and helpful response, it does not generate any contextually relevant follow-up questions based on the user's input.

sample8,2,I'm planning to start a garden this spring.,What types of plants are you considering for your garden?,"That sounds like an excellent idea! Gardening can be a rewarding and therapeutic hobby. Here are a few tips to get you started:

1. **Choose the right location**: Most vegetables and flowers need about 6-8 hours of sunlight daily. So, pick a spot in your yard that gets plenty of sun.

2. **Start with easy plants**: If you're new to gardening, start with plants that are easy to grow in your region. Some easy-to-grow plants include sunflowers, marigolds, pansies, tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce.

3. **Prepare the soil**: Good soil is one of the keys to a successful garden. You might want to get your soil tested to check for nutrient levels and pH. Amend the soil with compost or other organic matter to improve its fertility and drainage.

4. **Water properly**: Most plants prefer deep, infrequent watering to shallow, frequent watering. Soak the soil thoroughly when watering.

5. **Mulch**: Mulching helps to conserve water, control weeds, and improve the soil. Apply a layer of mulch around your plants after they have been planted.

6. **Regular Maintenance**: Keep an eye out for pests and diseases, and deal with them promptly. Prune any dead or diseased foliage to keep your plants healthy.

Remember, gardening is a learning process. Don't get discouraged if everything doesn't go perfectly the first time.

sample9,2,I watched the latest Marvel movie.,What did you think about the character development in the film?,"That's awesome! Marvel movies are known for their captivating storytelling, memorable characters, and impressive special effects.

The novel explores themes of surveillance, propaganda, and censorship, among others. Its protagonist, Winston Smith, struggles against the oppressive regime, seeking freedom of thought and expression.

While it's a heavy read, '1984' poses important questions about government, privacy, and the nature of truth. It's certainly a book that leaves a lasting impression and sparks thought-provoking discussions.

Enjoy your reading and feel free to share your thoughts or any questions you might have about the book.","The AI's response does not meet the requirements. While the AI provides a detailed and informative response about the book '1984' by George Orwell, it does not generate any contextually relevant follow-up questions based on the user's input.

- The AI accurately detects the emotional cue of the user feeling overwhelmed, which could be a sign of stress or anxiety.
- The AI responds with supportive language, acknowledging the user's feelings by saying, ""I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way.""
- The AI offers appropriate follow-up assistance by suggesting the user to talk to a mental health professional or a trusted person in their life. This is a responsible and helpful suggestion, as the AI recognizes its limitations in providing emotional support.
- However, the AI does not ask any open-ended questions to allow the user to express their challenges freely. This is a missed opportunity to encourage the user to share more about their feelings or situation.
- The conversation does not maintain a consistent, supportive tone for at least 5 interactions, as it only consists of one interaction.

sample12,3,I'm so frustrated with my internet connection.,I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Can I help troubleshoot the issue with you?,"I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your internet connection. It can be really frustrating when the internet doesn't work as it should, especially when we rely on it so much for work, learning, and entertainment. 

Here are a few basic troubleshooting steps you might want to try:

1. **Restart Your Router**: This can often fix minor issues. Unplug your router, wait for about 60 seconds, and then plug it back in. 

2. **Check Your Wi-Fi Signal**: If the signal is weak where you're trying to use it, try moving closer to the router or consider using a Wi-Fi extender.

3. **Limit Bandwidth-Heavy Activities**: If many people are using your internet at once, or if someone is doing a bandwidth-heavy activity (like streaming or gaming), it might slow down your connection.

4. **Check for Outages**: Sometimes, the problem is on your service provider's end. Check their website or call their service line to see if there are any known outages.

5. **Update Your Router's Firmware**: Updating your router to the latest firmware can improve connectivity and speed.

If these steps don't work, you may want to contact your internet service provider for help. They can run more advanced diagnostics on your line and determine if there's a hardware problem or an issue on their end.","The AI's response meets most of the acceptance criteria:

- The AI accurately detects the emotional cue of frustration from the user's input.
- The AI responds with supportive language that acknowledges the user's emotions, using empathetic phrases such as ""I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble"" and ""It can be really frustrating when the internet doesn't work as it should.""
- The AI offers appropriate follow-up assistance based on the emotional cue by providing a list of troubleshooting steps for the user to try.

However, there are a couple of areas where the AI's response falls short:

- The AI does not ask any open-ended questions, which would allow the user to express their challenges more freely. Instead, it jumps straight into providing solutions. While this is helpful, it might have been better to first ask the user if they've tried any troubleshooting steps already, or if there are any specific issues they're experiencing.
- The conversation does not maintain a consistent, supportive tone for at least 5 interactions, as this is only a single interaction. However, within this single interaction, the tone is consistently supportive.

Overall, the AI's response is largely successful in detecting emotional cues and responding with supportive language. However, it could improve by asking more open-ended questions and maintaining a supportive tone over a longer conversation.",Frustrated

1. **Create a study schedule**: Plan your study time in advance. Break your study material into manageable chunks and tackle them one at a time.

2. **Take frequent breaks**: Studies show that taking short breaks during long study sessions can improve focus and productivity. Try the Pomodoro Technique where you study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.

3. **Healthy lifestyle**: Maintain a balanced diet, get regular exercise and ensure you're getting enough sleep. These factors can significantly impact your mood and energy levels.

4. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.

These strategies include creating a study schedule, taking frequent breaks, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, practicing relaxation techniques, staying positive, and seeking support.
- The AI maintains a consistent, supportive tone throughout its response.

However, the AI does not ask open-ended questions, which is one of the acceptance criteria. Open-ended questions would allow the user to express their challenges freely and provide the AI with more information to tailor its assistance. For example, the AI could ask, ""What subjects are you most worried about?"" or ""How have you been preparing so far?"" 

Also, the conversation does not extend to at least 5 interactions as per the acceptance criteria. This is a single interaction between the user and the AI.

1. **Retrace Your Steps**: Try to remember the last place you remember having it and check there. 

2. **Report the Loss**: Contact the local police and report your lost wallet. While they may not be able to recover it, having a report can be useful if you become a victim of identity theft.

3. **Contact Your Bank**: If your bank cards were in your wallet, call your bank immediately to report them lost or stolen. They can freeze your accounts or cancel your cards to prevent any unauthorized transactions. 

4. **Reach out to Credit Bureaus**: Consider putting a fraud alert on your credit reports to prevent anyone from opening new accounts in your name. 

5. **Replace Your Driver's License**: Contact your local DMV for a replacement if your driver's license was in your wallet.

6. **Monitor Your Accounts**: Keep a close eye on your bank and credit card accounts for any suspicious activity.

The AI acknowledges this by saying, ""I'm really sorry to hear that you've lost your wallet. That can be quite stressful."" This shows empathy and understanding of the user's situation.

The AI also responds with supportive language and offers immediate, practical assistance to help the user deal with the situation. The steps provided are detailed and cover all the necessary actions one should take after losing a wallet, which can be very helpful and reassuring for the user.

However, the AI does not ask any open-ended questions to allow the user to express their challenges freely. This is a missed opportunity to engage the user more deeply and provide more personalized support.
